utility-categories
==================

Various utility categories that I find useful.  I will add categories as I find new usecases.

It does the following things so far:
* Configurable shadows for UIViews without too much repetitive CALayer stuff.
* Create bold and italic versions of a font.
* Enable font scaling for multi-line UILabels. (largest font that fits.)
* Allows font and color manipulation on mutable attributed strings (ios 6 style)
